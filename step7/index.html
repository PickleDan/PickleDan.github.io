          <p><span>T</span>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep
            within everyone, even
            though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are
            just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, setting for something much less
            than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationships grow is by showing respect.</p>

          <p>I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing
            someone extra special attension, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
